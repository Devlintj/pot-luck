# Pot Luck

You are in charge of throwing the annual CS Pot Luck. Fortunately, you are very organized and have kept track of the current rsvps in `people.csv` and the food requirements in `foods.csv`. You have decided to automate the process for future students.

## Guests
Write a program that determines how many guests are scheduled to attend the party.

## RSVP
Write a program that will add a person to the guest list. Each person needs a name, an email address, number of guests (min: 1, max: 10), and food to bring (it must be from the approved list). When a guest is added, remove their food from the list. Save all information to the data files.

Modify your program to allow guest removal, or updating their info.
